# html-and-css-mini

Minimal setup to start hacking on a website using HTML & CSS.

```
git clone git@github.com:radekosmulski/website-mini.git
cd website-mini
npm install
# open index.html and styles.css in your favorite editor
npx live-server
```

If you make changes to either `index.html` or `styles.css` and save, the webpage should reload. You should be able to see the effects of changes that you've made in the browser without taking any additional actions.

## Exercises

There is also a way to use this repository to practice. I created exercises based on two fabulous resources: 

* [internetingishard](https://www.internetingishard.com/)
* [scrimba free css grid course](https://scrimba.com/learn/R8PTE)

My recommendation would be to go to the above, study the material and come here to do the exercises.

I list the exercises below. You can checkout the `starting` branch, see if you can implement the layout from the image and compare to the `done` branch. The starting branch will contain all the code you need to get started.

I work on these exercises [having the editor, image of what I am implementing and a browser window open on my screen](https://github.com/radekosmulski/html-and-css-mini/blob/images/images/me_doing_exercises.png?raw=true). By saving I can immediately see any changes that I have made. This is a really good environment for learning as it allows me to try out many things very quickly.

I also find having this [awesome flexbox cheatsheet](https://www.alsacreations.com/xmedia/guidelines/flexbox-cheatsheet.pdf) printed out on my desk very helpful.
