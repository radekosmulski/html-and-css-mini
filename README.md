# html-and-css-mini

Minimal (and in many senses optimal) setup to start hacking on a website using HTML & CSS.

To start hacking:

```
git clone git@github.com:radekosmulski/website-mini.git
cd website-mini
npm install
# open index.html and styles.css in your favorite editor
npx live-server
```

If you make changes to either `index.html` or `styles.css` and save, the webpage should be reloaded. You should be able to see the effect of changes that you've made in the browser without taking any additional actions.
